# Serverless-email-subscriptions
### :orange_heart: :yellow_heart:This is a way to rely on third-party forwarding to achieve serverless email subscriptions.:yellow_heart: :orange_heart:
#### Firstly, we need to rigister an account on https://www.emailjs.com/, then set the Email service and create Email template.
#### After that, set the service ID as 'contact_service' and set the template ID as 'contact_form' (You can set the values as you like, just make sure they are the same with the values in HTML file).
#### Then modify the HTML file, set the 'PUBLIC_API_KEY' as your own public API key.
#### Run it, your email box will receive the message as the template.:wink:
